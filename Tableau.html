								<center><p><strong> Global Shark attack Analysis</strong></p></center>
								<p>This dataset chronicles shark attacks from 1900 to 2017, providing details such as location, activity, victim demographics (name, gender, age), and shark species involved. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the prevalence of shark attacks across different countries, identify peak seasons and times of day for attacks, and determine which country had the highest incidence.</p>

									<p>Key Insights:
									
										The United States reported the highest number of shark attacks among other countries analyzed, with new Smyrna Beach noted for the highest attack occurrences by location.
										Shark attacks were most common during the afternoons and mornings, this could be the increased beach visitation during hot weather.</p>
									<p>Recommendation:
										To reduce shark encounters, awareness should be raised among tourists, and educational programs should be implemented at beaches to inform visitors about the risks and benefits of swimming in the ocean.</p>

								<center><p><strong>Shipping ports around the world</strong></p></center>
								<p>
									This project visualizes global shipping activities, examining aspects of maritime trade and logistics that have led to an increase in the number of ports and vessels worldwide. The comprehensive study evaluates port performance, the number of vessels and ports in various countries, and their economic impact, using data provided by Quantum Analytics NG.</p>
								<p>Goal: the goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how global trade and economic factors have contributed to the proliferation of ports and vessels worldwide.</p>
								<p>Key insight: Shanghai port has the highest number of vessels in their port with a total of 2,420, likely due to high levels of global trading activities and industrialization. China Leads with the most ports with a total 122, attributed to its large population, massive production, high consumption, and extensive global trade, necessitating more ports to meet demand.</p>
								<p>Recommendation: 
									Upgrade and expand port facilities to manage increasing trade volumes efficiently. Countries with fewer ports and vessels should adapt their port strategies and operations to changes in the global maritime industry to enhance trade, leading to the development of more ports and vessels.
